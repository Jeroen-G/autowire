# ðŸ”Œ Autowire for Laravel

[![Latest Version on Packagist][ico-version]][link-packagist]

Autowire and configure using PHP 8 Attributes in Laravel.

## Installation

Via Composer

``` bash
composer require jeroen-g/autowire
```

You will need the configuration file to change where it should look:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=autowire.config
```

## Usage

### Autowiring

Are you tired of binding abstract interfaces to concrete classes all the time?

```php
$this-app->bind(HelloInterface::class, WorldClass::class);
```

Use the PHP 8 attribute of this package to autowire any of your interfaces:

```php
namespace App\Contracts;

use JeroenG\Autowire\Attribute\Autowire;

#[Autowire]
interface HelloInterface
{
    public function hello(): string;
}
```

The class that implements that interface does not need any changes:

```php
namespace App;

use App\Contracts\HelloInterface;

class WorldClass implements HelloInterface
{
    public function hello(): string
    {
        return 'world';
    }
}
```

The Autowire package will crawl through the classes and bind the abstract interface to the concrete class.
If there already is a binding in the container it will skip the autowiring.

### Configure

Personally I like injection of dependencies over resolving them using `make()` helpers.
However, that means writing binding definitions such as:

```php
$this->app->when($x)->needs($y)->give($z);
```

Not anymore with the Configure attribute!
Here is the WorldClass example again:

```php
namespace App;

use App\Contracts\HelloInterface;

#[Configure(['$message' => 'world'])]
class WorldClass
{
    private $message;

    public function __construct($message)
    {
        $this->message = $message;
    }
}
```

In this example message is a simple string.
However, it can be a reference to a configuration value or other class too!
The notations of config and service definitions is the same as used in Symfony. 

```php
// Will get the value set in config/app.php
#[Configure(['$message' => '%app.message%'])]

// Will inject an instance of the Message class
#[Configure(['$message' => '@App\Domain\Message'])]

// When you have multiple constructor arguments
#[Configure(['$message' => '%app.message%', '$logger' => '@Psr\Log\LoggerInterface'])]
```

### Listen to events

If you use a lot of events, the `EventServiceProvider` will very likely become long and messy:

```php
protected $listen = [
    Registered::class => [
        UpdateLastLogin::class,
        ...
    ],
    ...
];
```

With the PHP 8 attribute of this package you can define the events for a listener alongside each other:

```php
#[Listen(Registered::class)]
#[Listen(Login::class)]
class UpdateLastLoginListener {
   ...
}
```

The package will crawl through the classes and bind the listeners to the event classes.

### Caching

The autowiring, configuration and listeners can be cached with the command `php artisan autowire:cache`.
In a similar fashion it can be cleared with `php artisan autowire:clear`.
Keep in mind that caching means that it won't crawl all the classes and changes to the annotations will not be loaded.

## Configuration

The package's configuration can be found in `config/autowire.php`.
It should contain the list of directories where Autowire should look for both interfaces and implementations. 

## Custom attributes

It is possible to use custom Attribute classes for either or both the autowiring or configuration functionality:
- Create a custom attribute class, making sure to implement either `JeroenG\Autowire\Attribute\AutowireInterface` or `JeroenG\Autowire\Attribute\ConfigureInterface`, depending on the attribute you want to replace.
- Add a `autowire_attribute`, `configure_attribute` or `listen_attribute` setting to the `config/autowire.php` file, containing the fully-namespaced name of your custom attribute class.
- Use your custom attribute to mark the interface or class you want to autowire or configure.
